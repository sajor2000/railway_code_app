# GCP Cloud Run Requirements for Medical Coding Intelligence Platform
# Optimized for Google Cloud deployment with healthcare-grade performance

# Core Dependencies
pydantic>=2.5.0
pydantic-settings>=2.1.0

# API Framework
fastapi>=0.109.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0
python-multipart>=0.0.7

# Database and Vector Store
pinecone-client==5.0.1
redis>=5.0.0
motor>=3.3.0

# Medical Terminology APIs
requests>=2.31.0
httpx>=0.26.0
aiohttp>=3.9.0

# Data Processing (lightweight)
pandas>=2.1.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# OpenAI
openai>=1.12.0

# BioBERT Embeddings (lightweight alternative to torch/transformers)
biobert-embedding==0.1.2
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0

# Utilities
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# Export Formats
pyyaml>=6.0.1
jinja2>=3.1.0

# Security
python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0
cryptography>=41.0.0

# Note: For GCP Cloud Run deployment, BioBERT embeddings are handled via:
# 1. Pinecone vector database (pre-computed medical embeddings)
# 2. OpenAI embeddings as fallback for new medical terms
# 3. Full BioBERT available for local development (install torch/transformers separately)
# 
# This approach provides:
# - Fast GCP Cloud Run deployment without heavy ML dependencies
# - Medical domain accuracy via pre-computed BioBERT vectors in Pinecone
# - Scalable architecture for production healthcare use
